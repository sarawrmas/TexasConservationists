                Doug has been a conservationist for 50 years and is one of
                the founding members of Central Texas Conservation. With vast
                knowledge and experience in all things outdoors, he is a
                go-to resource for everyone on the team, and a valuable asset
                to the organization.

              <p>
                Jane has dedicated her life to studying the social interactions
                of chimpanzees while working to preserve their habitat. Without
                wildlife, there is no conservation. Her 60+ years of expertise
                working with primates brings a new perspective to the group.

                Steve is a zookeeper with an adventurous spirit. His optimism and
                fearlessness have afforded him opportunities to interact with
                many of the Earth's creatures. Today, he is dedicating his time to
                preserving nature and all if its inhabitants.
